### You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases:
  * General purpose
  * Compute*optimized
  * Memory*optimized
  * Accelerated Computing
  * Storage optimized
  * Instance features
  * Measuring instance
### AWS has the following naming convention:
  * m: instance class
  * 5: generation ( AWS improve it over time)
  * 2xlarge: size within the class

### The purpose of instance types
  * Great for a diversity of workloads, such as web servers or code repositories
  * Balance between computing, memory, and networking
 
#### Compute optimize: Greate for the compute*intensive task that requires high*performance processors:
  * Batch processing workloads
  * Media transcoding
  * High*performance web servers
  * High*performance computing (HPC)
  * Scientific modeling & machine learning
  * Dedicate gaming servers

#### Memory optimized: Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
  * High*performance, relational/non*relational databases
  * Distributed web*scale cache store
  * In*memory databases optimized for BI (Business intelligence)
  * Applications performing real*time processing of big unstructured data.

#### Storage Optimized: Great for storage*intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage.
  * High*frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  * Relational & NoSQL databases
  * Cache for in*memory databases (for example, redis)
  * Data warehousing applications
  * Distributed file systems
