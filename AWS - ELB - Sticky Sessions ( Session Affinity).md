* It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
* This works for Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, and Network Load Balancer
* The "cookie" used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
* Use case: Ensure the user doesn't lose his session data.
* Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances.

### Cookie Names

   * Application Cookies
   - Generated by the load balancer
   - Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
* Duration-based Cookies
   - Cookie generated by the load balancer
