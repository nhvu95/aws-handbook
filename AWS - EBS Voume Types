## EBS Volume types

* EBS Volumes come in 6 types
     * gp2 / gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
     * io1 / io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
     * st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
     * sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

* EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS ( I/O Ops Per Sec)
* When in doubt, always consult the AWS documentation - it's good!
* Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes

### I. General Purpose SSD
* Cost-effective storage, low-latency
* System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
* 1 GiB to 16 TiB per second
* gp3: 
   * Baseline of 3000 IOPS and throughput of 125MiB/s
   * Can increase IOPS up to 16000 and throughput to 1000 MiB/s independently
* gp2: 
   * Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3000
   * The size of the volumes and IOPS are linked max IOPS is 16000
   * 3 IOPS per GB, means at 5334 GB we are at the max IOPS

### II. Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
* Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
* Or applications that need more than 16000 IOPS
* Great for database workloads ( sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
* io1/io2 (4 GiB - 16TiB):
   * Max PIOPS: 64000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32000 for other
   *  Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
   * io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GiB ( at the same price as io1)
* io2 Block express (4GiB - 64TiB):
   * Sub-millisecond latency
   * Max PIOPS: 256000 with an IOPS: GiB ratio of 1000:1
* Supports EBS Multi-attach

### III. Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
* Cannot be a boot volume
* 125GB to 16TiB
* Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
   * Big Data, Data warehouse, Log processing
   * Max throughput 500 MiB/s - max IOPS 500
* Cold HDD (scl)
   * For data that is infrequently accessed
   * Scenarios where lowest cost is important
   * Max throughput 250MiB/s - max IOPS 250
