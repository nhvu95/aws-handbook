* When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following
    * Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
    * All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
    * All the snapshot are encrypted
    * All volumes created from the snapshot
* Encryption and decryption are handled transparently ( you have nothing to do)
* Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
* EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS ( AES-256)
* Copy an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption

### To Encrytion: encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume
* Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
* Encrypt the EBS snapshot (using copy)
* Create new EBS volume from the snapshot (The volume will also be encrypted)
* Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance
